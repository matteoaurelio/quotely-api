ðŸ“„ Quotely Privacy Policy
Effective Date: May 28, 2025

This privacy policy describes how Quotely handles information provided through its GPT Assistant and connected services.

1. Information Collection
Quotely does not collect, store, or share any personal data. When you interact with the GPT, the data you provide is processed temporarily for the purpose of generating CSV files with selected quotes. All interactions are ephemeral and not retained by the API or the assistant.

2. File Handling
Any files generated (e.g., CSV files) are created dynamically and served directly to you. These files are not stored permanently, nor are they accessible to others. All temporary files are deleted immediately after serving the response.

3. Third-party Services
Quotely uses Render.com to host its backend services and OpenAI to deliver the assistant interface. Both services may log technical metadata (e.g., IP address, request headers) for security and reliability purposes, in accordance with their respective privacy policies.

4. Security
We do not use authentication or user tracking at this stage. The API is designed to be lightweight, ephemeral, and only accessible by the GPT assistant.

5. Contact
